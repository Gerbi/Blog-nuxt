      "description": "GraphQL is a data query language developed by Facebook. It provides an alternative to REST and ad-hoc webservice architectures. It allows clients to define the structure of the data required, and exactly the same structure of the data is returned from the server. It is a strongly typed runtime which allows clients to dictate what data is needed."

Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.
